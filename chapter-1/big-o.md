Big O
- Quick sort picks a random element and swaps values in the array such that elements smaller than the pivot go to the left of the pivot.
    - then, it recursively sorts the left and right sides using a similar process
    - If all elements are equal, quick sort will traverse the array once === O (n)
The expected and worst cases describe the big 0 time for particular scenarios
Big O describes the upper, lower, and tight bounds for the runtime.

Space Complexity
- Think of the memory required for an algorythm.
- array of size n takes O (n) space
- 2D array will be of size 0(n*)
